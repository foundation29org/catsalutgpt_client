            "t1": "What is GPT-4o?",
            "p1": "GPT-4o is a type of language model, which is a computer program capable of generating natural language text based on an input. Language models are trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, articles, social media messages, and websites, to learn the patterns and probabilities of language. GPT-4o is one of the most advanced language models to date, as it can generate coherent and diverse texts in various domains and tasks, such as writing stories, answering questions, summarizing texts, and translating languages. GPT-4o is based on a neural network architecture called a transformer, which allows it to capture long-range dependencies and complex relationships between words and phrases.",
            "t2": "What are the limitations of GPT-4o for medical use?",
            "p2.1": "Quality and quantity of data: GPT-4o is trained on a vast amount of text data, but not all of it is relevant, accurate, or reliable for medical use. For example, some text data may contain misinformation, biases, errors, or outdated information that can mislead GPT-4o or compromise its performance. Additionally, some rare diseases may not have enough text data available to sufficiently train GPT-4o, resulting in low coverage or confidence.",
            "p2.2": "Ethical and regulatory issues: GPT-4o is not a certified or authorized medical device and does not intend to replace human doctors or provide definitive diagnoses. GPT-4o is merely a tool that provides suggestions that may offer possible hypotheses based on limited information. Therefore, the use of GPT-4o for medical purposes can raise ethical and legal concerns, such as privacy, consent, liability, accountability, and trust. Users of GPT-4o should be aware of these issues and use CatSalutGPT with caution and responsibility.",
            "p2.3": "Generalization and adaptation: GPT-4o is a general-purpose language model, which means it can generate texts for various domains and tasks, but it may not be specialized or optimized for specific medical domains or tasks. For example, GPT-4o may not be able to grasp the nuances, terminology, or logic of medical reasoning, or it may not be able to adapt to different patient contexts, such as age, gender, ethnicity, or medical history. Therefore, GPT-4o may need to be adjusted or customized for specific medical situations or applications, which may require additional data, resources, or expertise.",
            "t3": "How are these limitations managed in CatSalutGPT?",
            "p3.1": "Reducing hallucinations and incorrect responses: GPT-4o can produce hallucinations or incorrect responses, which are texts that are not supported by factual knowledge. This can happen because GPT-4o is trained on a broad and diverse corpus of texts, which may contain noise, errors, inconsistencies, or biases. Additionally, GPT-4o relies on a probabilistic model, which means it can generate different outputs for the same input, depending on the sampling method and temperature parameter. Therefore, using GPT-4o for medical diagnosis can pose risks of misleading or inaccurate results. To reduce these risks, CatSalutGPT employs prompt engineering techniques and low temperature. Prompt engineering is the process of designing GPT-4o's input and output texts to obtain the desired response. For example, CatSalutGPT uses prefixes, keywords, and formatting techniques to guide GPT-4o in generating a list of differential diagnoses instead of a narrative text. Low temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output. By setting a low temperature, CatSalutGPT makes the output more deterministic and consistent, rather than diverse and creative. This can help avoid hallucinations or highly unlikely or implausible incorrect responses. However, low temperature can also reduce the coverage or variety of the output, which may result in omitting some rare or complex diagnoses. Therefore, CatSalutGPT should be used as a complementary tool, not as a definitive source, for medical diagnosis.",
            "p3.2": "Managing input and output information: GPT-4o can generate texts that are not safe, appropriate, or relevant for medical diagnosis, such as offensive, sensitive, or personal information. This can happen because GPT-4o has not been trained or tested for medical diagnosis and may not be aware of the ethical, legal, or social implications of its outputs. To prevent or mitigate these issues, CatSalutGPT employs input and output management techniques. Input management is the process of filtering, cleaning, or anonymizing the input data to protect patient privacy and security. For example, CatSalutGPT does not accept any personally identifiable information as input data, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or personal medical records. Output management is the process of monitoring, reviewing, or editing the output data to ensure quality, accuracy, and safety. Additionally, CatSalutGPT allows the user to flag, report, or correct any problematic results, to provide feedback and improve the system.",

            "p4.1.4": "The doctor can also ask CatSalutGPT to provide clinical reasoning to explain the likelihood of each suggested diagnosis.",
            "p4.1.5": "With this additional information about each potential diagnosis, the doctor can determine whether further evaluation or referral to a specialist is warranted.",
            "p4.2": "The goal of CatSalutGPT is to provide decision support and expand the diagnostic range by including possible diseases that doctors may not immediately recognize based on symptoms alone. However, it is not intended to replace professional medical advice or confirm an actual diagnosis.",
            "t5": "Clinical studies",
            "p5": "Sant Joan de Déu Hospital has conducted a comprehensive clinical study evaluating the performance of CatSalutGPT compared to highly qualified medical professionals for both common and rare diseases.

            "p6.2.1": "Claude 3 Opus performed best among previously tested models, achieving 55% strict accuracy (correct diagnosis as first suggestion) and 70% top-5 accuracy (correct diagnosis among top five suggestions)",

            "p6.4": "Importantly, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are significantly faster and more cost-effective than their predecessors like Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4. This increased efficiency means these advanced diagnostic capabilities could potentially be offered for free to a much larger number of users worldwide, vastly expanding access to AI-assisted diagnosis for rare diseases.",
            "p6.5": "Additionally, both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet have set new records in diagnosing common diseases. In our tests using the Urgency dataset for common conditions, both models achieved an impressive top-5 accuracy of around 89%. This demonstrates that these AI models are not only advancing in rare disease diagnosis but are also highly capable when it comes to more frequent medical conditions [4].",
            "p6.6": "These findings indicate that the latest AI models are making significant strides in diagnosing both rare and common diseases while becoming more accessible, which could have a substantial impact on global healthcare.",

            "p6.10": "It is crucial to emphasize that CatSalutGPT is still in development and is intended as a decision support tool, not as a replacement for professional medical judgment [1][5]. The tool aims to assist healthcare professionals by generating diagnostic hypotheses based on patient symptoms and clinical data, potentially reducing time to diagnosis for rare and common diseases [2][5]. Further validation on real clinical data and comparison with human expert diagnoses is needed to fully assess its performance and potential impact on patient care [1][4].
