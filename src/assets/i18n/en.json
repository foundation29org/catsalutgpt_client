The tool aims to assist healthcare professionals by generating diagnostic hypotheses based on patient symptoms and clinical data, potentially reducing time to diagnosis for rare and common diseases [2][5]. Further validation on real clinical data and comparison with human expert diagnoses is needed to fully assess its performance and potential impact on patient care [1][4]. We are also conducting these studies in hospitals and the first results will be published soon.",
